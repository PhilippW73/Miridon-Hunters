Aside from already having immense strength, grand devourers can furter boost their innate strength with discipline and training. Grand devourers are generally considered the rulers of Miridon’s towns and the empire. The most famous grand devourer is the emperor himself.

", "Skiffmasters are a versatile class, focusing on non-battle skills to build up a parties power. Skiffmasters command troops into battle, attempting to use the power of numbers to their advantage. A skiffmaster will rarely be the front-line fighters of Miridon, despite being able to hold their own, but they will organize the weaker units, arm the warriors, and fortify the defenses. They also build and run the mobile fortresses known as skiffs. They build the infrastructure of Miridon and manage their underlings. Behind every grand devourer claiming to be the ruler of an area, there are several skiffmasters actually managing the domain.

They specialize in fast attacks and jeers. While they are necessarily strategically the best targets to go after on the battlefield, their flamboyant attitude will draw many attackers to focus their attacks on them.

", "While any human being can be possessed by ghosts, only vessels have trained their bodies to make full use of the benefits possession has to offer. They learn to control the ghosts to an extent that few others would even think possible, turning potential insanity into a powerful weapon. They can even use their ghosts to curse another with insanity. In the Miridonian world, one famous vessel is the mad Gogo, who houses one thousand ghosts.

", "Techies are researchers of the lost arts. While Miridonians are descendents and remnants of the space faring human race, many have lost all knowledge of such technologies. The loss of interest generally comes from the fact that human strength and speed far surpasses that of most technology. Techies, however, believe otherwise and work to create guns and mechs that can compete with powerful Miridonians. Techies do their best work in private, and are often found in underground caves building giant robotic armies. While they may not be able to compete physically with many Miridonians, their technology is a force to be reckoned with.

", "Ghost hunters are the most critical characters in any party. While many characters are trained in the art of killing other humans, only ghost hunters are trained in capturing the ghosts of the world. Because of their unique skill set and the laws protecting ghost hunters, they are generally treated as heroes. All ghost hunters are trained by another ghost hunter and can trace their training back to the first ghost hunter, Warren. Warren invented ghost bullets, and, despite being still alive and openly traveling the world, is revered as a sort of mythical hero of old. Warren himself has even found it impossible to convince others of his identity. ", "", 6, 10, 50, 0, "Puzzle Creation ");
